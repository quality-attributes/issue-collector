To ensure its stability, it is important to run it on different machines.\nRunning automated test\nPrerequisites\n\nUpdate stable to the latest version.\nClose all VS Code instances that will be used in a test (e.g. latest insiders, stable) not to have any interference with the running test that will spawn them itself.\n\nOnce the test is running, please do not interfere with it by doing selection or focusing anywhere within spawned test VS Code instance.\nApproximate running time\n10 minutes minimum (the more failures it has, the more it runs due to adaptive retry strategy of the waiting time).\nProcedure\n\nRun git checkout michelkaporin/smoketest in vscode repository. Currently the code lives on my branch only.\ncd test/smoke\nnpm install\nnpm test -- --latest \"path/to/binary\" --stable  \"path/to/binary\", where latest argument is the path to VS Code executable to conduct testing, and stable is previous stable version (in order to run 'Data Migration' tests). If the latter argument is ommited, 'Data Migration' tests won't run.\n\nExample commands:\nnpm test -- --latest \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\\Code - Insiders.exe\" --stable \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe\"\nor\nnpm test -- --latest \"/Applications/Visual Studio Code - Insiders.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron\" --stable \"/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron\"\nKnown problems\n\n**#27452 bug results in very many failing tests on OS X, once that is fixed, all should pass.\nSpectron spawns multiple cmd windows on Windows OS. This leads to VS Code window to be overlapped by another one. To look at what the test does you need to click on the VS Code title bar to focus on it in every test. (electron-userland/spectron#60)\n\nIf you get failing tests, please dump the log with failed error messages here.\nAny feedback is appreciated üëç"

The 3rd party SVN extension has this feature, even the old dinosaur Eclipse has it.\nI was even more confused when I didn't find a duplicate in the issues.  Am I missing something?  If I am, could someone please let me know what do Git users do in VSCode (admittedly I am coming from CVS/SVN and am new to Git) to see remote changes? (without using the 3rd party plugin GitLens which is not easy to navigate with all the clutter).  I assume people just don't 'sync' or 'pull' blindly without knowing what changes are coming in?"

Then using downward arrow keys focus goes to items in treeview.\nExpected:\nKeyboard focus should not move to the items as a whole which is non-interactive. The focus should move to first item in the treeview.\nRecommendations:\nRemove tab-index from the outer  that contains all the treeview items.\nor,\nRefer below link which is repository of bug fixes code snippets:\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/msenable/mas/pages/browse-fixes.aspx\nUser Impact:\nThe keyboard only users will move to non-interactive elements on the screen which will be time consuming to reach only interactive elements on the page.\nMAS Reference:\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/msenable/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc={8492c4eb-c179-40ae-8777-cd044ed725a2}\nAttachment for Reference:\nA11y_VSCode_ViewExplorer_Keyboard_TreeViewItems.pptx\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes"

This behavior is not only annoying but it doesn't allow me to scroll say terminal window, because scrolling simply shows the list of last run commands - the same as if you press up arrow key multiple times. Horizontal scrolling behaves as left/right arrow keys - instead of scrolling horizontally, I move the caret. I have a wireless Microsoft mouse and when I use it for scrolling, everything works a expected. When I use my touchpad to scroll in the same way any other application like Chrome, Notepad, whatever, it behaves normally (the caret stays on its location and only the view is scrolled - actually I can normally scroll this GitHub's text area I am writing the issue text in). Does anyone have such problem with VSCode ? Could it because of touchpad drivers (I think mine is \"ELAN Pointing Device\") ?\nList of extensions:\n1 Debugger for Chrome 2.7.0\n2.

On Linux and Windows it can have the value \"ctrl\" or \"alt\". On OSX it can have the value \"cmd\" or \"alt\". Please check:\n\nthe default is \"alt\" (just as before). So without any changes, out of the box, multiple cursors are added via \"alt\" + click. It is a known issue that under some Linux distributions, multiple cursors cannot be added via \"alt\" + click, which is used to move windows, this new option aims to also overcome this limitation.\nwhen using alt as the multicursor modifier: ctrl+click (cmd+click) is used for going to definition and opening links. ctrl+alt+click (cmd+alt+click) is used for going to definition and opening in a side editor and for opening a link in a side editor (you can craft a file:/// link to test this)\nwhen using ctrl or cmd as the multicursor modifier, the 3 features swap modifiers and going to definition / opening a link is alt+click. ctrl+alt+click (cmd+alt+click) will still be used for going to definition / opening a link to the side. The hover message on links correctly shows the modifier to be used to open a link."
