                "bodyText": "Steps to Reproduce\nThe end goal is to create a scrolling list that automatically \"snaps\" to a given location based on the actual scroll position at which the user stops scrolling. This may not be the best solution (I'm new to Flutter), but here's the process by which I get the crash:\nWrap a ListView within a NotificationListener. Upon receiving a UserScrollNotification with ScrollDirection.idle, call the ScrollController's animateTo() method to scroll to another location (in the example here, I arbitrarily scroll to 10000.0 pixels).\nSample code\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\nvoid main() => runApp(new MyApp());\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  // This widget is the root of your application.\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return new MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Scroller issue',\n      home: new MyHomePage(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {\n  final _controller = new ScrollController();\n\n  bool _didGetNotification(ScrollNotification notification) {\n    if (notification is UserScrollNotification) {\n      if (notification.direction.toString() == \"ScrollDirection.idle\") {\n        // We've stopped scrolling... now animate automatically to the 10000-pixel spot\n        _controller.animateTo(10000.0, duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), curve: Curves.elasticOut);\n\n        /* Above works great... unless the user tries to interact with the list WHILE it's\n        // animating. In this case, you end up with:\n        **********************************************************************************\n        Another exception was thrown: 'package:flutter/src/widgets/scrollable.dart':\n          Failed assertion: line 472 pos 12: '_hold == null || _drag == null': is not true.\n        ********************************************************************************** */\n      }\n    }\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return new Scaffold(\n      body: new NotificationListener(\n        onNotification: _didGetNotification,\n        child: new ListView.builder(\n          padding: new EdgeInsets.all(8.0),\n          controller: _controller,\n          itemExtent: 60.0,\n          itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {\n            return new Text('Item No. $index');\n          },\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\nIt works great as long as the user only interacts with the ListView when it is idle, but if the user attempts to scroll/drag/touch the list during the animateTo() process, the following exception is raised within the Flutter Scrollable package:\n'package:flutter/src/widgets/scrollable.dart': Failed assertion: line 472 pos 12: '_hold == null || _drag == null': is not true.\n\nAfter this, the ListView becomes unresponsive.\nI'm sure there's a better way to achieve what I'm trying to do, but the platform itself doesn't seem to recover from this. Figured I'd make a note of it.\nThanks!\nLogs\nRun your application with flutter run and attach all the log output.\n    CADisplay.name = LCD;\n    CADisplay.deviceName = PurpleMain;\n    CADisplay.seed = 1;\n    tags = 0;\n    currentMode = <FBSDisplayMode: 0x604000097430; 375x667@2x (750x1334/2) 60Hz sRGB SDR>;\n    safeOverscanRatio = {0.89999997615814209, 0.89999997615814209};\n    nativeCenter = {375, 667};\n    pixelSize = {750, 1334};\n    bounds = {{0, 0}, {375, 667}};\n    CADisplay = <CADisplay:LCD PurpleMain>;\n}\nSyncing files to device iPhone 6s...                  1.9s\n\n🔥  To hot reload your app on the fly, press \"r\".

Everything works just fine in my iPhone X.\nI have modified the application to add a Firebase connection with a Firestore DDBB. If I run the application from Android Studio directly in my phone, it works, and it shows the data from the database. If I archive the app and upload it to iTunes Connect, and install it through TestFlight, when opening the application, it just appears as a white screen. The application works but shows nothing, but an empty white screen.\nDo you know what is happening or how I can get information that can help to solve my problem?\nRegards"

I mainly want to determine if there is a bug with showDrawer or with the way I attempted to use it.\nYesterday, I attempted to use showDrawer with the 7be58b1 alpha branch of Flutter. The drawer appeared/dismissed correctly, and the widgets I put in the drawer were correct.\nUnfortunately, I noticed that no matter how I attempted to change the state of what was drawn in the drawer, it would not re-render. In my case, I tried to put a Switch inside a DrawerItem to toggle debug mode for my app. I did confirm that the state did actually change, which led me to think that Flutter has a bug.\nI was following the Stocks demo app quite closely, which uses a Drawer to toggle the user's market sentiment (Optimistic vs Pessimistic). However, I was assuming that the app's behavior would match the Sky Demo app in the Google Play Store. I only just realized that this app is actually 3 months old (last update August 25), so it is very possible that in that time, the Stocks example does not function as it did before.\nI am currently unable to try running these examples (though I have found the instructions), so if someone else can run the Stocks app and determine whether the Optimistic/Pessimistic radio buttons update the drawer menu or not, that would be very helpful.\nOtherwise, I will look into this more after the break."
